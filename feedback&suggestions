Curl command examples, complete basic walkthrough (like opscenter APIs).  Include examples from cqlsh/astra console. Fully graphic walkthrough. Schema explanation? 

"Try it out" and "execute" button in Swagger might need tutorial/detailed doc

If create table with wrong data, how to replace with same name? Example, created using raw data, but need to use json. Do we drop? Just avoid this and change name?

Astra cqlsh console slow. Intermittently times out/resets.  Standalone cqlsh necessary

Keyspace == namespace(?)  DatabaseID == clusterID(?) Not clear in documentation, where do we find and map information to rest calls? Consistency
